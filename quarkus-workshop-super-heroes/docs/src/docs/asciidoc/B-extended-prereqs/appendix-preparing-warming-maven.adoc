= Warming up Maven

== Download the workshop scaffolding

[example, role="cta"]

First, download the zip file  {github-raw}/dist/quarkus-super-heroes-workshop.zip, and unzip it wherever you want.
This zip file contains _some_ of the code of the workshop, and you will need to complete it.

== Download the Maven dependencies

[example, role="cta"]
--

Now that you have the initial structure in place, navigate to the root directory and run:


[source,shell]
----
./mvnw clean install

By running this command, it downloads all the required dependencies.
