= Running the Application on Azure Container Apps

'''

Now that we have containerized our application, push it to Azure Container Registry and execute it locally, time to execute it on Azure Container Apps.
In this chapter we will create the needed infrastructure in Azure Container Apps (database, Kafka, etc.) and then deploy the containers so we can execute our application.

== Deploying the Infrastructure

Before deploying our microservices to Azure Container Apps, we need to create the infrastructure.

=== Create a Container Apps environment

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

First, let's create the container apps environment.
A container apps environment acts as a boundary for our containers.
Containers deployed on the same environment use the same virtual network and the same Log Analytics workspace.
Create the container apps environment with the following command:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocCreateACAEnv]
----

=== Create the managed Postgres Databases

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

We need to create three PostgreSQL databases so the Heroes, Villains and Fights microservice can store data.
Because we also want to access these database from external SQL client, we make them available to the outside world thanks to the `-public all` parameter.
Create the databases with the following commands:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocCreatePostgresH]
----

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocCreatePostgresV]
----

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocCreatePostgresF]
----

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Then, we create the database schemas, one for each database:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocCreateSchemaH]
----

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocCreateSchemaV]
----

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocCreateSchemaF]
----

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Now that we have all our databases setup, time to create the tables and add some data to them.
Each microservice comes with a set of database initialization files as well as some insert statements.
Thanks to Azure CLI we can execute these SQL scripts.
Create the tables using the following commands (make sure you are under `quarkus-workshop-super-heroes/super-heroes` to execute them):

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocInitTableH]
----

[NOTE]
====
If you get the error `No module named 'psycopg2._psycopg'` that means that some of your Azure CLI dependencies are not correctly installed.
Check https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/21998 for help.

include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocInitTableF]
----

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Now, let's add some super heroes and super villains to these databases:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocImportDataH]
----

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocImportDataV]
----

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocImportDataF]
----


You can check the content of the tables with the following commands:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocSelectDataH]
----

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocSelectDataV]
----

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocSelectDataF]
----

=== Create the Managed Kafka

The Fight microservice communicates with the Statistics microservice through Kafka.
We need to create an Azure event hub for that.

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocCreateEventHub]
----

Then, create the Kafka topic where the messages will be sent to and consumed from:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocCreateEventHubTopic]
----

To configure Kafka in the Fight and Statistics microservices, get the connection string with the following commands:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-setup-aca-env.sh[tags=adocEventHubConnection]
----

If you log into the https://portal.azure.com[Azure Portal] you should see the following created resources.

== Deploying the Applications

Now that the Azure Container Apps environment is all set, we need to deploy our microservices to Azure Container Apps.
So let's create an instance of Container Apps for each of our microservices and User Interface.

[NOTE]
====
If you haven't built the containers and push them to your own Azure Container Registry, you need to change some environment variables.
That means, that instead of having `REGISTRY="superheroesregistry"$UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER`, you need to change it to `REGISTRY="superheroesregistry` (so it uses the common registry).

[source,shell]
----
REGISTRY="registrysuperheroesagoncal"

REGISTRY_URL=$(az acr show \
  --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --name "$REGISTRY" \
  --query "loginServer" \
  --output tsv)

HEROES_IMAGE="${REGISTRY_URL}/${HEROES_APP}:${IMAGES_TAG}"
VILLAINS_IMAGE="${REGISTRY_URL}/${VILLAINS_APP}:${IMAGES_TAG}"
FIGHTS_IMAGE="${REGISTRY_URL}/${FIGHTS_APP}:${IMAGES_TAG}"
STATISTICS_IMAGE="${REGISTRY_URL}/${STATISTICS_APP}:${IMAGES_TAG}"
UI_IMAGE="${REGISTRY_URL}/${UI_APP}:${IMAGES_TAG}"
----

====

=== Heroes Microservice

First, the Heroes microservice.
The Heroes microservice needs to access the managed Postgres database.
Therefore, we need to set the right properties using our environment variables.
Notice that the Heroes microservice has a `--min-replicas` set to 0.
That means it can scale down to zero if not used (more on that later).

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Create the Heroes container app with the following command:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-deploy-aca.sh[tags=adocCreateAppHero]
----

The following command sets the URL of the deployed application to the `HEROES_URL` variable:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-deploy-aca.sh[tags=adocAppHeroURL]
----

You can now invoke the Hero microservice APIs with:

[source,shell]
----
curl "$HEROES_URL/api/heroes/hello"
curl "$HEROES_URL/api/heroes" | jq
----

To access the logs of the Heroes microservice, you can write the following query:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-deploy-aca.sh[tags=adocAppHeroLogs]
----

[WARNING]
====
You might have to wait to be able to get the logs.
Log analytics can take some time to get initialized.
====

=== Villains Microservice

The Villain microservice also needs to access the managed Postgres database, so we need to set the right variables.

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Notice the minimum of replicas is also set to 0:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-deploy-aca.sh[tags=adocCreateAppVillain]
----

The following command sets the URL of the deployed application to the `VILLAINS_URL` variable:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-deploy-aca.sh[tags=adocAppVillainURL]
----

You can now invoke the Hero microservice APIs with:

[source,shell]
----
curl "$VILLAINS_URL/api/villains/hello"
curl "$VILLAINS_URL/api/villains" | jq
----

To access the logs of the Villain microservice, you can write the following query:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-deploy-aca.sh[tags=adocAppVillainLogs]
----

=== Statistics Microservice

The Statistics microservice listens to a Kafka topics and consumes all the fights.

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Create the Statistics container application with the following command:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-deploy-aca.sh[tags=adocCreateAppStatistics]
----

The following command sets the URL of the deployed application to the `STATISTICS_URL` variable:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-deploy-aca.sh[tags=adocAppStatisticsURL]
----

You can now display the Statistics UI with:

[source,shell]
----
open "$STATISTICS_URL"
----

To access the logs of the Statistics microservice, you can write the following query:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-deploy-aca.sh[tags=adocAppStatisticsLogs]
----

=== Fights Microservice

The Fight microservice invokes the Heroes and Villains microservices, sends fight messages to a Kafka topics and stores the fights into a MongoDB database.
We need to configure Kafka (same connection string as the one used by the Statistics microservice) as well as the Postgres database.
As for the microservice invocations, you need to set the URLs of both Heroes and Villains microservices.

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Create the Fights container application with the following command:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-deploy-aca.sh[tags=adocCreateAppFight]
----

The following command sets the URL of the deployed application to the `FIGHTS_URL` variable:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-deploy-aca.sh[tags=adocAppFightURL]
----

Use the following curl commands to access the Fight microservice.
Remember that we've set the minimum replicas to 0.
That means that pinging the Hero and Villain microservices might fallback (you will get a _That means that pinging the Hero and Villain microservices might fallback (you will get a That means that pinging the Hero and Villain microservices might fallback (you will get a _Could not invoke the Villains microservice_ message).
Execute several times the same curl commands so Azure Containers Apps has time to instantiate one replica and process the requests:

[source,shell]
----
curl "$FIGHTS_URL/api/fights/hello"
curl "$FIGHTS_URL/api/fights" | jq
curl "$FIGHTS_URL/api/fights/randomfighters" | jq
----

To access the logs of the Fight microservice, you can write the following query:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-deploy-aca.sh[tags=adocAppFightLogs]
----

=== Super Hero UI

Like for the previous microservices, we will be deploying the UI as Docker image as we did for the previous microservices.
But we could have also deployed the Super Hero UI using Azure Static Webapps which is suited for Angular applications.
If you are interested in this approach, you can check https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/static/[Azure Static Webapps].

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

For now, let's continue with Azure Container Apps and deploy the UI as a Docker image with the following command:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-deploy-aca.sh[tags=adocCreateAppUI]
----

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-deploy-aca.sh[tags=adocAppUIURL]
----

[source,shell]
----
open "$UI_URL"
----

To access the UI logs, you can write the following query:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/azure-deploy-aca.sh[tags=adocAppUILogs]
----

== Running the Application

Now that the entire infrastructure is created and the microservices deployed, you can use all the following commands to either, directly invoke the APIs, or use the user interfaces:

[source,shell]
----
curl "$HEROES_URL/api/heroes" | jq
curl "$VILLAINS_URL/api/villains" | jq
curl "$FIGHTS_URL/api/fights/randomfighters" | jq
open "$STATISTICS_URL"
open "$UI_URL"
