== Recap

Before going further, make sure the following commands work on your machine.

[source,shell]
----
java -version
$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/native-image --version
curl --version
docker version
docker compose version
ifdef::use-local-kubernetes[]
kubectl version # If you used Rancher Desktop and plan to use Kubernetes
endif::use-local-kubernetes[]

We have not mentioned cURL up to now, because most modern operating systems ship
with it pre-installed. If your system is missing cURL,
the appendix includes xref:appendix-installing-curl[instructions for installing cURL].
