= Warming up Docker images

To warm up your Docker image repository, navigate to the `quarkus-workshop-super-heroes/super-heroes/infrastructure` directory.
Here, you will find a
ifdef::use-mac,use-windows[`docker-compose.yaml`]
ifdef::use-mac+use-linux[ or ]
ifdef::use-linux[`docker-compose-linux.yaml`]
file which defines all the needed Docker images.
Notice that there is a `db-init` directory with an `initialize-databases.sql` script which sets up our databases, and a `monitoring` directory (all that will be explained later).

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Then execute the following command which will download all the Docker images and start the containers:

[source,shell]
----
ifdef::use-mac,use-windows[]
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
endif::use-mac,use-windows[]
ifndef::use-mac,use-windows[]
docker compose -f docker-compose-linux.yaml up -d
endif::use-mac,use-windows[]
----

ifdef::use-linux[]
[WARNING]
.Linux Users beware
====
If you are on Linux, use `docker-compose-linux.yaml` instead of `docker-compose.yaml`. This Linux specific file will allow Prometheus to fetch metrics from the services running on the host machine.
====
endif::use-linux[]

[WARNING]
====
If you have an issue creating the roles for the database with the `initialize-databases.sql` file, you have to execute the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
docker exec -it --user postgres super-database psql -c "CREATE ROLE superman LOGIN PASSWORD 'superman' NOSUPERUSER INHERIT NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE NOREPLICATION"
docker exec -it --user postgres super-database psql -c "CREATE ROLE superbad LOGIN PASSWORD 'superbad' NOSUPERUSER INHERIT NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE NOREPLICATION"
docker exec -it --user postgres super-database psql -c "CREATE ROLE superfight LOGIN PASSWORD 'superfight' NOSUPERUSER INHERIT NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE NOREPLICATION"
----
====

After this, verify the containers are running using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml ps
----

The output should resemble something like this:

[source,shell]
----
     Name                   Command               State           Ports
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
kafka            sh -c bin/kafka-server-sta ...   Up      0.0.0.0:9092->9092/tcp
super-database   docker-entrypoint.sh postgres    Up      0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp
super-visor      /bin/prometheus --config.f ...   Up      0.0.0.0:9090->9090/tcp
zookeeper        sh -c bin/zookeeper-server ...   Up      0.0.0.0:2181->2181/tcp
----

Once all the containers are up and running, you can shut them down and remove their volumes with the commands:

[source,shell]
----
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml down
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml rm
----

[NOTE]
====
.What's this infra?
Any microservice system is going to rely on a set of technical services.
In our context, we are going to use PostgreSQL as the database, Prometheus as the monitoring tool, and Kafka as the event/message bus.
This infrastructure starts all these services, so you don't have to worry about them.

This infra will only be used when we run our services in _prod_ mode. In _dev_ mode, Quarkus will start everything for us.
