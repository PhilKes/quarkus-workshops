[[microservices-ui]]
= User Interface

Now that we have the three main microservices, time to have a decent user interface to start fighting.
The purpose of this workshop is not to develop a web interface and learn _yet another web framework_.
This time you will just execute another Quarkus instance with an already Angular application.
We will be using https://quarkiverse.github.io/quarkiverse-docs/quarkus-quinoa/dev/[Quinoa]
to handle building and serving the Angular application.

== Quinoa?

https://quarkus.io/extensions/io.quarkiverse.quinoa/quarkus-quinoa[Quinoa] is a Quarkus extension which eases the development of single page apps or web components.
It lets you live code the backend and frontend together with close to no configuration.
It also helps with both packaging and serving, and if you want it to, abstracts away `npm`.

When enabled in development mode, Quinoa will start the UI live coding server provided by the target framework and forward relevant requests to it.
In production mode, Quinoa will run the build and process the generated files to serve them at runtime.

Quinoa is framework-agnostic, and works with React, Angular, Vue, Lit, and others.
 â€¦) alongside other Quarkus services (REST, GraphQL, Security, Events, etc).

== The Web Application

Navigate to the `super-heroes/ui-super-heroes` directory.
It contains the code of the application.

The Angular application is in `src/main/webui`.
Being an Angular application, you will find a `package.json` file which defines all the needed dependencies.
All the Angular code (graphical components, model, services) is located under `src/main/webui/src/app`.

== Running the Web Application

We don't need to worry too much about the Angular code.

[example, role="cta"]
--
From the `ui-super-heroes`
directory, use `./mvnw quarkus:dev` to start the web application.

Be sure you have the hero, villain and fights microservices running (dev mode is enough).
--

If you don't have Node installed, Quinoa will install it during the start process (under the `.quinoa` directory).

----

----

You should see console output like the following

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]

2023-05-18 14:22:03,237 INFO  [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) ui-super-heroes 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT on JVM (powered by Quarkus {quarkus-version}) started in 24.765s. Listening on: http://localhost:8080
----

Once the application is started, go to http://localhost:8080 (8080 is the default Quarkus port as we didn't change it in the `application.properties` this time).
It should display the main web page.

ifdef::use-ai[]
image::angular-ui-ai.png[role=half-size]
endif::use-ai[]
ifndef::use-ai[]
image::angular-ui.png[role=half-size]
endif::use-ai[]

If you want, you can visit http://localhost:4200 (the usual Angular port) to confirm that Quinoa is forwarding what's on port 4200 to port 8080.
The version of the application on http://localhost:4200 will be disappointingly blank,
because it's looking for its config on the wrong port.

You might want to create a fuller Quarkus BFF for the UI, and use something like https://quarkus.io/guides/stork[Stork] for service discovery.
However, that's beyond the scope of this workshop!

== Live coding the UI

Live coding works for the javascript parts of the application, just as it does for the Java ones.

[example, role="cta"]
--
Open `src/main/webui/src/app/app.component.html` and edit the text, perhaps by adding 'Hello there' into the welcome message.
Check localhost:8080, and your new content should appear.
(It may take a moment or two for the refresh to trigger.)

You can also change the javascript code.
For example, try updating the text in `src/main/webui/src/app/app.component.ts`.
--

== Native compilation and Quinoa

You can compile the UI application as a native binary, just like other Quarkus applications.

[example, role="cta"]
--

Try compiling natively with

----
./mvnw package -Pnative
./target/ui-super-heroes-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
----

The native compilation will take a while, but once it's done, the UI will start in around 0.02s.
You can confirm it's working by checking http://localhost:8080.
