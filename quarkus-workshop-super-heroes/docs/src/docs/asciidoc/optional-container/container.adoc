'''

In this chapter we will build containers out of our Quarkus microservices and execute them locally thanks to Docker Compose.
Thanks to Quarkus Cloud Native capabilities, we will be able to build and execute containers easily.

We will also produce Linux 64 bits native executables and runs them in a container.
The native compilation uses the OS and architecture of the host system.

== Building containers

When we generated our microservices, Quarkus has generated a set of `Dockerfiles`.
The `Dockerfile.native` file is for running the application in native mode.
It looks like this:

[source,text]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal:8.5
WORKDIR /work/
RUN chown 1001 /work \
    && chmod "g+rwX" /work \
    && chown 1001:root /work
COPY --chown=1001:root target/*-runner /work/application

EXPOSE 8080
USER 1001

CMD ["./application", "-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0"]
----

[example, role="cta"]
--
Check that you have all the Docker images installed locally:

[source,shell]
----
docker image ls | grep quarkus
----

The output should look like this:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus/ui-super-heroes         latest      266MB
quarkus/event-statistics        latest      145MB
quarkus/rest-fights             latest      198MB
quarkus/rest-villains           latest      158MB
quarkus/rest-heroes             latest      154MB
----
--


== Running containers locally

Now that we have all our Docker containers created, let's execute them all to be sure that everything is working.

[example, role="cta"]
--
Under `super-heroes/infrastructure` you will find the `docker-compose-app-local.yaml` file.
It declares all the needed infrastructure (databases, Kafka) as well as our microservices.
Execute it with:

[source,shell]
----
docker compose -f docker-compose-app-local.yaml up
----

To know that all your containers are started, you can use the following command:

[source,shell]
----
docker compose -f docker-compose-app-local.yaml ps
----

You should get something similar to the following list.
Make sure all your containers are in _running_ status:

[source,shell]
----
event-statistics    "./application -Dqua…"   running
kafka               "sh -c 'export CLUST…"   running
rest-fights         "./application -Dqua…"   running
rest-heroes         "./application -Dqua…"   running
rest-villains       "./application -Dqua…"   running
super-database      "docker-entrypoint.s…"   running (healthy)
ui-super-heroes     "/bin/sh -c 'npm sta…"   running
----

Once all the containers are started, you can:

* Go to http://localhost:8080 to check the main UI
* Go to http://localhost:8085 to check the statistics UI
* curl http://localhost:8084/api/villains | jq
* curl http://localhost:8083/api/heroes | jq
* curl http://localhost:8082/api/fights/randomfighters | jq

Then, make sure you shut down the entire application with:

[source,shell]
----
docker compose -f docker-compose-app-local.yaml down
----
--

== Building native executables


And... Linux Containers are ... _Linux_.
So before being able to build a container with our native executable, we need to produce compatible native executables.
If you are using a Linux 64 bits machine, you are good to go.
If not, Quarkus comes with a trick to produce these executable:







The `Dockerfile.native` file is for running the application in native mode.
It looks like this:

[source,text]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal:8.5
WORKDIR /work/
RUN chown 1001 /work \
    && chmod "g+rwX" /work \
    && chown 1001:root /work
COPY --chown=1001:root target/*-runner /work/application

EXPOSE 8080
USER 1001

CMD ["./application", "-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0"]
----







[source,shell]
----
./mvnw clean package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true -DskipTests
----

The `-Dquarkus.native.container-build=true` allows running the native compilation inside a container (provided by Quarkus).
The result is a Linux 64 bits executable.

[TIP]
====
Building a native executable takes time, CPU, and memory.
It's even more accurate in the container.
So, first, be sure that your container system has enough memory to build the executable.
It requires at least 6Gb of memory, 8Gb is recommended.
====

[example, role="cta"]
--

Execute the above command for all our microservices.
We also copy the UI into the fight service, to simplify the process:

[source,shell]
----
cd rest-hero
./mvnw clean package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true -DskipTests
cd ..
cd rest-villains
./mvnw clean package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true -DskipTests
cd ..
cd rest-fight
cp -R ../ui-super-heroes/dist/* src/main/resources/META-INF/resources
./mvnw clean package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true -DskipTests
cd ..
cd event-statistics
./mvnw clean package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true -DskipTests
cd ..
----
--

== Building native containers

Now that we have the native executables, we can build containers.
When you create projects, Quarkus generates two `Dockerfiles`:

1. `Dockerfile.jvm` - A `Dockerfile` for running the application in JVM mode
2. `Dockerfile.native` - A `Dockerfile` for running the application in native mode

We are interested in this second file.
Open one of these `Dockerfile.native` files:

[source,text]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal
WORKDIR /work/
COPY target/*-runner /work/application
RUN chmod 775 /work
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./application", "-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0"]
----

It's a pretty straightforward `Dockerfile` taking a minimal base image and copying the generated native executable.
It also exposes the port 8080.
Wait, our microservices are not configured to run on the port 8080.
We need to override this property as well as a few other such as the HTTP client endpoints, and database locations.

To build the containers, use the following scripts:

[source,shell]
----
export ORG=xxxx
cd rest-hero
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.native -t $ORG/quarkus-workshop-hero .
cd ..
cd rest-villains
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.native -t $ORG/quarkus-workshop-villain .
cd ..
cd rest-fight
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.native -t $ORG/quarkus-workshop-fight .
cd ..
cd event-statistics
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.native -t $ORG/quarkus-workshop-stats .
cd ..
----

[NOTE]
====
Replace `ORG` with your DockerHub / Quay.io username.

== Running native containers locally










== Building a container

This section demonstrates how to ask Quarkus to create a container.

Quarkus is able to build a container image automatically.
It proposes multiple approaches to do so, but we recommend using https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[jib].

The resulting image follows the container good practices such as the usage of layers, avoiding the `root` user...

[example, role="cta"]
--
Add the `quarkus-container-image-jib` extension using the following command:

[source, shell]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="jib"
----
--

It adds the following dependency to the `pom.xml` file:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-container-image-jib</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[example, role="cta"]
--
Then, launch the following command to build the application and create the container image:

[source, shell]
----
./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true
----

Once done, verify that the container image has been created using:

[source, shell]
----
docker images | grep villains
----

You should get a similar output:

[source, shell]
----
.../rest-villains              1.0.0-SNAPSHOT         1298cad04f5e   About a minute ago   388MB
----

== Building a container running a native executable

We've just created a container that embeds the Java application and a JVM.
But you can also build and use the native executable.
To do this, runs the following command:

[source, shell]
----
./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
----

`-Dquarkus.native.container-build=true` is indicating that we need a Linux 64bits executable.
This option is not required if you use Linux.
