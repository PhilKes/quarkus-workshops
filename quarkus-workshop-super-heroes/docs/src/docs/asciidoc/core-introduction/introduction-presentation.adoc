= Presenting the Workshop

This workshop should give you a practical introduction to Quarkus.
You will practice all the needed tools to develop an entire microservice architecture, mixing classical HTTP, reactive and event-based microservices.
You will finish by extending the capabilities of Quarkus and learn more about the ability to create native executables.

The idea is that you leave this workshop with a good understanding of what Quarkus is, what it is not, and how it can help you in your projects.
Then, you'll be prepared to investigate a bit more and, hopefully, contribute.

== What Will You Be Developing?

In this workshop, you will develop an application that allows superheroes to fight against supervillains.
You will be developing several microservices communicating with each other:

* _Super Hero UI_: an Angular application to pick up a random superhero, a random supervillain, and makes them fight.
The Super Hero UI is exposed via Quarkus and invokes the Fight REST API
* _Villain REST API_: A classical HTTP microservice exposing CRUD operations on Villains, stored in a PostgreSQL database
* _Hero REST API_: A reactive HTTP microservice exposing CRUD operations on Heroes, stored in a Postgres database
ifdef::use-ai[]
* _Narration REST API_: This microservice talks to OpenAI/Azure OpenAI to generate a random narration of the fight.
endif::use-ai[]
* _Fight REST API_: This REST API invokes the Hero and Villain APIs to get a random superhero and supervillain.
ifdef::use-ai[]
It also invokes the Narration API to get a random narration of the fight.
endif::use-ai[]
Each fight is, then, stored in a PostgreSQL database.
This microservice can be developed using both the classical (_imperative_) or reactive approach.
Invocations to the other microservices are protected using resilience patterns (retry, timeout, circuit-breakers)
ifdef::use-messaging[]
* _Statistics_: Each fight is asynchronously sent (via Kafka) to the Statistics microservice.
It has an HTML + JQuery UI displaying all the statistics.
endif::use-messaging[]
ifdef::use-observability[]
* _Prometheus_: Polls metrics from the three microservices Fight, Hero, and Villain.
endif::use-observability[]
ifdef::use-cli[]
* _Command Line Interface_: Quarkus can also be used to create CLI applications.
You will create a CLI application that adds load to the Fight, Hero, and Villain microservices.

The main UI allows you to pick up one random Hero and Villain by clicking on "New Fighters."
Then it's just a matter of clicking on "Fight!" to get them to fight.
ifdef::use-ai[]
If you click on "Narrate the Fight", you will have some AI-generated text describing the fight.
endif::use-ai[]
The table at the bottom shows the list of the previous fights.

The Statistics UI shows the number of fights per hero and villain.

== How Does This Workshop Work?

You have this material in your hands (either electronically or printed), and you can now follow it step by step.
The structure of this workshop is as follows:

* _Installing all the needed tools_:
in this section, you will install all the tools and code to be able to develop, compile and execute our application
* _Developing microservices with Quarkus_:
in this section, you will develop a microservice architecture by creating several Maven projects, write some Java code, add JPA entities, JAX-RS REST endpoints, write some tests, use an Angular web application, and all that on Quarkus
ifdef::use-ai[]
* _Artificial Intelligence_:
in this section, you will use OpenAI or Azure OpenAI to invoke an AI so you can generate a random narration of the fight
endif::use-ai[]
ifdef::use-messaging[]
* _Event-driven and Reactive microservices_:
in this section, you will create a reactive microservice and an event-driven microservice using Kafka
endif::use-messaging[]
ifdef::use-native[]
* _Build native executables_:
in this section, you will build native executables of all the microservices thanks to GraalVM
endif::use-native[]
ifdef::use-kubernetes[]
* _Containers & Cloud_:
in this section, you will create Docker images of all the microservices and deploy them to Kubernetes
endif::use-kubernetes[]
ifdef::use-observability[]
* _Observability_:
in this section, you will add metrics, health checks, and distributed tracing to your microservices
endif::use-observability[]
ifdef::use-azure[]
* _Azure Container Apps and Quarkus_:
this section introduces Quarkus and Azure Container Apps to make sure you have all the needed vocabulary to follow along
* _Running the Application Locally_:
in this section, you will build Docker images out of Quarkus microservices, execute them locally with Docker compose, push them to Azure Registry, all that using Docker and Azure CLI
* _Running the Application on Azure Container Apps_:
in this section, you will create an entire infrastructure on Azure (Postgres databases, Kafka, etc.) and deploy the microservices to Azure Container Apps
endif::use-azure[]
ifdef::use-cli[]
* _Command Line Interface_:
in this section, you will create a command line application with Quarkus
endif::use-cli[]
ifdef::use-extension[]
* _Extending Quarkus_:
in this section, you will create a Quarkus extension
endif::use-extension[]

If you already have the tools installed, skip the _Installing all the needed tools_ section and jump to the section _Developing with Quarkus_, and start hacking some code and add-ons.
This "Ã  la carte" mode lets you make the most of this 6-hour long hands-on lab.

== What Do You Have to Do?

This workshop should be as self-explanatory as possible.
So your job is to follow the instructions by yourself, do what you are supposed to do, and do not hesitate to ask for any clarification or assistance; that's why the team is here.

You will download a zip file ({github-raw}/dist/quarkus-super-heroes-workshop.zip[`quarkus-super-heroes-workshop.zip`]) containing _some_ of the code and you will need to complete it.

Oh, and be ready to have some fun!


[NOTE]
====
If you are stuck, you can always look at the final code in the {github-url}[GitHub repository], or download another zip file ({github-raw}/dist/quarkus-super-heroes-workshop-complete.zip[`quarkus-super-heroes-workshop-complete.zip`]) that contains _all_ the code of the workshop.
If you want to build the completed workshop, after you've unzipped the {github-raw}/dist/quarkus-super-heroes-workshop-complete.zip[`quarkus-super-heroes-workshop-complete.zip`] file, you would need to run the following command from the root project:

[source, shell]
----
$ ./mvnw clean install -Pcomplete
----

ifdef::use-extension[]
The extension can be built with the following command:

[source, shell]
----
$ ./mvnw clean install -f super-heroes/extension-version
----
endif::use-extension[]
====


== Software Requirements

First of all, make sure you have a 64-bit computer with admin rights (so you can install all the needed tools) and at least 8Gb of RAM (as some tools need a few resources).

ifdef::use-mac[]
[WARNING]
====
If you are using Mac OS X, make sure the version is greater than 10.11.x (El Capitan).
====
endif::use-mac[]

This workshop will make use of the following software, tools, frameworks that you will need to install and know (more or less) how it works:

* Any IDE you feel comfortable with (eg. Intellij IDEA, Eclipse IDE, VS Code..)
* JDK {jdk-version}
ifdef::use-native[]
* GraalVM {graalvm-version}
endif::use-native[]
* Docker or Podman
* cURL (or any other command line HTTP client) and optionally `jq` (check the xref:appendix-installing-jq[appendix for installation instructions])
ifdef::use-ai[]
* OpenAI or Azure OpenAI keys (optional, only if you want to use the narration feature)
endif::use-ai[]
ifdef::use-azure[]
* An Azure subscription and the Azure CLI
endif::use-azure[]

We will also be using Maven {maven-version}, but there is no need to install it.
Instead, the workshop scaffolding includes a maven wrapper, `mvnw`.
If you'd prefer to install your own Maven and don't already have it, xref:appendix-installing-maven[see the instructions at the end of the workshop].

The following section focuses on how to install and set up the needed software.
You can skip the next section if you have already installed all the prerequisites.

[WARNING]
====
This workshop assumes a bash shell.
ifdef::use-windows[If you run on Windows, in particular, adjust the commands accordingly or install WSL.]
