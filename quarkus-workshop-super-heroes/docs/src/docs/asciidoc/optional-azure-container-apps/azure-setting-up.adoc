= Setting Up Azure

To be able to deploy the application to Azure, you first need an Azure subscription.
If you don't have one, go to https://signup.azure.com and register.

[example, role="cta"]
--

Then, sign in to Azure from the CLI:

[source,shell]
----
az login
----

Make sure you are using the right subscription with:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-setup-azure-env.sh[tags=adocAzAccountShow]
----
--

== Setting Up the Azure Environment

Azure CLI is extensible and you can install as many extensions as you need.

[example, role="cta"]
--

For this workshop, install the Azure Container Apps and Database extensions for the Azure CLI:

[source,shell]
----
az extension add --name containerapp  --upgrade
az extension add --name rdbms-connect --upgrade
az extension add --name log-analytics --upgrade
----

You can then check the extensions that are installed in your system with the following command:

[source,shell]
----
az extension list
----

You should see the extensions that have been installed:

[WARNING]
====
If you are on Windows and using WSL, the extensions should be installed under `/home/<user>/.azure/cliextensions/`.
If it's not the case, and instead extensions are installed under `C:\\Users\\<user>\\.azure\\cliextensions`, you should reboot your computer.
====

[source,json]
----
[
  ...
  {
    "experimental": false,
    "extensionType": "whl",
    "name": "containerapp",
    "path": "/Users/agoncal/.azure/cliextensions/containerapp",
    "preview": true,
    "version": "0.3.4"
  },
  ...
]
----

Then, register the needed Azure namespaces:

[source,shell]
----
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.App
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Insights
----
--

= Creating Azure Resources

Before creating the infrastructure for the Super Heroes application and deploying the microservices to Azure Container Apps, we need to create some Azure resources.

== Setting Up the Azure environment variables

Let's first set a few environment variables that will help us in creating the Azure infrastructure.

[example, role="cta"]
--

Set the following variables:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-setup-env-var.sh[tags=adocEnvironmentVariables]
----

Now let's create the Azure resources.
--

== Resource Group

A https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal[resource group] is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution.
The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group.
In our workshop, all the databases, all the microservices, etc. will be grouped into a single resource group.

[example, role="cta"]
--

Execute the following command to create the Super Hero resource group:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-setup-azure-env.sh[tags=adocCreateResourceGroup]
----
--

== Log Analytics Workspace

https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace[Log Analytics workspace] is the environment for Azure Monitor log data.
Each workspace has its own data repository and configuration, and data sources and solutions are configured to store their data in a particular workspace.
We will use the same workspace for most of the Azure resources we will be creating.

[example, role="cta"]
--
Create a Log Analytics workspace with the following command:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-setup-azure-env.sh[tags=adocCreateLogAnalytics]
----

Let's also retrieve the Log Analytics Client ID and client secret and store them in environment variables:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-setup-azure-env.sh[tags=adocLogAnalyticsSecrets]
----
--

== Azure Container Registry

In the next chapters we will be creating Docker containers and pushing them to the Azure Container Registry.
https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry[Azure Container Registry] is a private registry for hosting container images.
Using the Azure Container Registry, you can store Docker-formatted images for all types of container deployments.

[example, role="cta"]
--

First, let's created an Azure Container Registry with the following command:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-setup-azure-env.sh[tags=adocCreateContainerRegistry]
----

Update the repository to allow anonymous users to pull the images:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-setup-azure-env.sh[tags=adocAnonymousContainerRegistry]
----

Get the URL of the Azure Container Registry and set it to the `REGISTRY_URL` variable with the following command:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-setup-azure-env.sh[tags=adocContainerRegistryURL]
----

If you log into the https://portal.azure.com[Azure Portal] you should see the following created resources.

= Setting Up the Environment Variables

The Super Heroes environment and application will be created and deployed using a set of Azure CLI commands.
Each of these commands need a set of parameters, and some of these parameters can be set of environment variables.

[example, role="cta"]
--

Set the following environment variables, there will be needed in the Azure CLI commands:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-setup-env-var.sh[tags=adocEnvironmentVariables2]
----
--

= Ready?

After the prerequisites have been installed and the different components have been warmed up, and some Azure resource created, it's now time to deploy some code!
But before, let us introduce Azure Container Apps and Quarkus.
