In this chapter we will push the containers we've created in the previous chapter to Azure Container Registry, and we will run them locally.
Later we will deploy them on Azure Container Apps.

== Pushing Local Images to Azure Container Registry

In the previous chapter we have built our Docker containers and run locally thanks to Docker Compose.

[example, role="cta"]
--
Check that you have all the Docker images installed locally before going further by executing the following command:

[source,shell]
----
docker image ls
----

The output should look like this:

[source,shell]
----
REPOSITORY                      TAG                  IMAGE ID       SIZE
<org>/rest-fights             1.0.0-SNAPSHOT       adb8a546a66b   419MB
<org>/rest-heroes             1.0.0-SNAPSHOT       d9e6ae6e3e23   402MB
<org>/rest-villains           1.0.0-SNAPSHOT       60a5c813f59a   402MB
<org>/ui-super-heroes         1.0.0-SNAPSHOT       82fce62c11a5   379MB
ifdef::use-messaging[]
<org>/event-statistics        1.0.0-SNAPSHOT       a5472c5bd576   395MB
endif::use-messaging[]
ifdef::use-ai[]
<org>/rest-narration          1.0.0-SNAPSHOT       fcfe334594f3   390MB
endif::use-ai[]
----
--

Now we will tag the images, push them to Azure Container Registry and execute them locally, again, with Docker Compose.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure you've set all the environment variables defined in the previous chapter and that you've also created the resource group and the Azure Container Registry.
====

[example, role="cta"]
--
Before you can push an image to your registry, you must tag it with the fully qualified name of your registry login server (the `REGISTRY_URL` variable).
Tag the image using the `docker tag` commands (make sure to change the value of `quarkus/` by the value of your local organisation):

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-build-push-registry.sh[tags=adocTaggingCore]
ifdef::use-messaging[]
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-build-push-registry.sh[tags=adocTaggingStat]
endif::use-messaging[]
ifdef::use-ai[]
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-build-push-registry.sh[tags=adocTaggingNarration]
endif::use-ai[]

----
--

[example, role="cta"]
--
Make sure all the images have properly been tagged by executing the following command:

[source,shell]
----
docker image ls
----

The output should look like this:

[source,shell]
----
REPOSITORY                      TAG                  IMAGE ID       SIZE
registrysuperheroes<uniquename>.azurecr.io/fights-app            1.0    f6605baa0b3c  461MB
registrysuperheroes<uniquename>.azurecr.io/heroes-app            1.0    c5acab2980c3  443MB
registrysuperheroes<uniquename>.azurecr.io/villains-app          1.0    666953f1bd0c  444MB
registrysuperheroes<uniquename>.azurecr.io/super-heroes-ui       1.0    879013ecd43a  420MB
ifdef::use-messaging[]
registrysuperheroes<uniquename>.azurecr.io/event-statistics      1.0    a5472c5bd576  395MB
endif::use-messaging[]
ifdef::use-ai[]
registrysuperheroes<uniquename>.azurecr.io/narration-app         1.0    50c657de360d  432MB
endif::use-ai[]
----

[example, role="cta"]
--
To be able to push these Docker images to Azure Registry, we first need to log in to the registry:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-build-push-registry.sh[tags=adocLogging]
----

You should see the prompt _Login Succeeded_.

Then, push all the images with the following commands:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-build-push-registry.sh[tags=adocPushingCore]
ifdef::use-messaging[]
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-build-push-registry.sh[tags=adocPushingStat]
endif::use-messaging[]
ifdef::use-ai[]
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-build-push-registry.sh[tags=adocPushingNarration]
endif::use-ai[]
----

You can check that the images have been pushed to Azure Container Registry by executing the following command:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-build-push-registry.sh[tags=adocListing]
----

You can also get some information on a particular repository or image if needed:

[source,shell,indent=0]
----
include::{projectdir}/infrastructure/azure-build-push-registry.sh[tags=adocShowing]
----

You can visualize the content of the registry on the https://portal.azure.com[Azure Portal].

== Running Remote Images Locally

Now that we have our docker images pushed to Azure Container Registry, we can run them locally with Docker Compose.
We will use the `docker-compose-app-remote.yaml` file under `super-heroes/infrastructure` to run the remote images locally.
But before we need to change a few things.

[example, role="cta"]
--
You should edit the `docker-compose-app-remote.yaml` file under `super-heroes/infrastructure` and change the name `registrysuperheroesagoncal` with the value of the `$REGISTRY` variable.
--

[example, role="cta"]
--
Now that we have all our Docker containers pushed to Azure Container Registry, let's execute them with:

[source,shell]
----
docker compose -f docker-compose-app-remote.yaml up
----
--
s
Once all the containers are started, you can:

* Go to http://localhost:8080 to check the main UI
* curl http://localhost:8084/api/villains | jq
* curl http://localhost:8083/api/heroes | jq
* curl http://localhost:8082/api/fights/randomfighters | jq
ifdef::use-messaging[]
* Go to http://localhost:8085 to check the statistics UI
endif::use-messaging[]

On http://localhost:8080 you should see the user interface, and you should be able to fight super heroes against super villains:

ifdef::use-ai[]
image::react-ui-ai.png[]
endif::use-ai[]
ifndef::use-ai[]
image::react-ui.png[]
endif::use-ai[]


ifdef::use-messaging[]
On http://localhost:8085 you should see the statistics of the fights.
When super heroes and super heroes are fights, the statistics shows which one has won the most fights, and the percentage of fights won by the two groups.
The UI is automatically updated at each fight:

image::react-ui-stats.png[]
endif::use-messaging[]

You should see the user interface and everything should work.
Remember to shutdown the entire application with:

[source,shell]
----
docker compose -f docker-compose-app-remote.yaml down
----

Ok, enough running these containers locally!
In the next chapter we will take these remote containers, configure them, and make them work remotely on Azure Container Apps.
